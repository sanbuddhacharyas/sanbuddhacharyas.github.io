Technological advancements in healthcare and medical field have saved millions of lives and
improved many others. But in context of Nepal still peoples are deprived of proper health
service. There are only few number of doctor available in remote areas. Also, in city area people
are busy doing their job so people are not aware about their present health condition and
unascertained about health problems like hypertension, arrhythmia, heart attack, high blood
pressure, sugar etc. Medical check-up has skyrocket price due to which bourgeois and
proletarian family couldn’t get chance to know their present health condition. To control this
types of health problem economically there requires something to instruct and warn about their
present health condition and make them aware about risk in near future. Considering above
problem, we are trying to make “Selcouth Health Care” a device which can measure 20
different body parameters such as (Blood Pressure, Heart Beat, Weight, Body Temperature,
Height, Fat Content, BMI, Muscular Mass, Water Content, Bone Mass, ECG etc.). Our device
will store body parameters of each person weekly and relates its result with previous data and
calculates there present health score. Using ECG output image, it will detect chance of
arrhythmia and heart attack in near future. It will co-relates its previous health state with present
health state and predicts there future health state. A single device will work as personal health
assistance for many people. People will not only get their health check-up but also get
suggestion and warning about risk of different health problems, which will make them aware
about their health condition.
