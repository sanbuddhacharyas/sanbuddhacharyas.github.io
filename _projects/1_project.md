Most people wants to buy the same product that they see in the movies and tik-tok. How do they search those product in e-Commerce site? Obviously, typing all the requirements in the search bar, Example: <em> "red shirt with logos in the middle", </em> with this you end up with different product. Only the text search available in the e-Commerce lowers the purchase rate since most of the user don't find what they actually searching for. But with the advancement of deep learning and computer vision automatic searching has been made easier. <em>Video to Online Shopping</em> automatically detects the central character in the video and automatically search for the product in the database. No any hassel to search, type, and open e-commerse site since the product will be available next to you in the video.
