<em>"Joe Rogan"</em> is an commentator, podcaster, comedian who takes thousands of dollor for 1 - 2 minute of voice clip. But what if we can clone the voice of JOE ROGAN with few voice clips. For advertisement, we can use deep learning to clone the voices of any person. We can make any number of advertisement with any voice. 
Cliping number of voices from podcast and training neural vocoder and encoder.

<b>Technologies used:</b> NLP, RNN, Python Language, TensorFlow, Pyaudio, NumPy, scikit-learn.
