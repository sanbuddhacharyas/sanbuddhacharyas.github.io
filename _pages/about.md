I am a machine learning engineer keen to solve real-world challenges using `computer vision` and `machine learning`. I have completed my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with <i>`summa cum laude`</i> from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. My interest is in object detection, object classification, image segmentation, image filtering, background removal, 3D vision, depth estimation, augmented reality, image similarity, color detection, human tracking, image blending, and recommendation systems.

I have two years of working experience in the industry and company. Recently, `I am searching for a research assistant position to work on computer vision and machine learning problems`. I have closely worked on projects such as monocular depth estimation, fashion image retrieval, music recommendation system, object recognization, tomato plant disease classification, arithmetic prediction, chess board tracker, etc. Besides my work, I have won four national technological competitions.

I am the former hardware coordinator at LOCUS Nepal. I possess strong leadership with creative problem-solving abilities. I am also a member of the Sakura Science Club Japan.
