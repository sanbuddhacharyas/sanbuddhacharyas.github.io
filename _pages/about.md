I am a machine learning engineer keen to solve real-world challenges using computer vision and machine learning. I have completed my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan
University, Nepal. My interest is in `computer vision` and `machine learning`, with a major focus on 3D vision, depth estimation, augmented reality, image similarity, object detection, image segmentation, and recommendation systems.

I have two years of working experience in the company. Recently, I am searching for a new position as a computer vision engineer. I have closely worked on projects such as monocular depth estimation, fashion image retrieval, music recommendation system, object recognization, human tracking, image blending, image painting, 3D reconstruction, etc. Besides my work, I have won four national technological competitions.

I am the former hardware coordinator at LOCUS Nepal. I possess strong leadership with creative problem-solving abilities. I am also a member of the Sakura Science Club Japan.
