I have completed my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan
University, Nepal. My research interest is in `Computer Vision` and `Machine Learning`, with major focus on 3D vision, depth estimation, augmented reality, image similarity, and recommendation system.

I have two years of working experience in research and industry. I am recently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Artlabs, New York. I have closely worked on research projects such as monocular depth estimation, fashion image retrieval, music recommendation system, object recognization, 3D reconstruction etc. Beside my work, I have won four national technological competitions.

I am the former hardware coordinator at LOCUS, Nepal. I possess strong leadership with creative problem-solving abilities. I am also the member of Sakura Science Club, Japan.
